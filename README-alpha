This is the GNU Inetutils package.
This document describes the actions needed to build the pre-release
or CVS version of the package. See end of file for copying conditions.

* Introduction

This is a *pre-release* version, and not ready for production use
yet. If you are taking source from CVS, you will need to have several
special tools to help contribute. See the file README-hacking for more
information, See chapter `Building' for the detailed instructions on
how to build the package.

Please, note that the accompanying documentation may be inaccurate
or incomplete. See ChangeLog for the list of recent changes.

Report bugs to <bug-inetutils@gnu.org>

If you see a problem that you've already reported, feel free to
re-report it -- it won't bother us to get a reminder.  Besides, the
more messages we get regarding a particular problem the sooner it'll
be fixed -- usually.  If you sent a complete patch and nobody applied
it or got back to you, please let us know!

* Checking Out the Sources

The following instructions apply if you wish to obtain sources from
the CVS repository:

  cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.gnu.org:/cvsroot/inetutils co inetutils

There is also a Git mirror of the CVS repository.  To obtain sources from
Git use:

  git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/inetutils.git
  
Both ways will give you read-only access.  If you think you need write
access, contact the mailing list.

* Building

Usual procedures apply:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

See INSTALL and README for the detailed instructions.

* Development

You can track the CVS process through the <commit-inetutils@gnu.org>
mailing list.  This is a medium volume moderated list.

Daily snapshots built from CVS are available from:

Log outputs from building the daily snapshot on some systems are
available from:
